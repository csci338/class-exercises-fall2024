# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization

```
kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises % ls -la
total 0
drwxr-xr-x  3 kategary  staff   96 Sep 10 10:43 .
drwxr-xr-x  4 kategary  staff  128 Sep 10 10:43 ..
drwxr-xr-x  9 kategary  staff  288 Sep 10 10:43 .git

```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command

```
kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises % git status
On branch main

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
	new file:   README.md

kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises %

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file

```
kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises % git commit -m "add README.md to the repository"
[main (root-commit) 4e39675] add README.md to the repository
 1 file changed, 1 insertion(+)
 create mode 100644 README.md

```

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output

```
kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises % git log
commit 4e396750aa5e440804a5164c2cf14a18fb19030c (HEAD -> main)

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output

```
kategary@Kates-MacBook-Air-3 lab03-exercises % git diff
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md
index 864a69b..d07485c 100644

+    return [num for num, freq in count.items() if freq > 1]
+
+# Example usage:
+nums = [1, 2, 3, 2, 4, 5, 3, 6, 6, 7]
+duplicates = find_duplicates(nums)
+print(duplicates)  # Output: [2, 3, 6]

```

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

- git init
- initializes a new repository
- git status
- gives a general overview of the items in each stage of Git
- git add
- adds files to be committed
- git commit
- commits files to be pushed
- git log
- shows a log of recent git history
- git diff
- shows changes between working directory and staged/added material

### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)

Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)

Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem

Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.

### 3.2. Link to Repo

Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
https://github.com/kgary432/lab03_excercises
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean?

merge: normal option, adds new commits into the main branch without conflicts and generates a merge commit
squash and merge: takes all of the commits from the branch and squashes them into one big commit, like when snakes eat one big meal instead of a much of little ones
rebase and merge: takes where the branch was created and moves that point to the last commit into the base branch, then applys the commits on top. basically a fast forward merge but when changes have happened to main in the meantime, very common in large projects
