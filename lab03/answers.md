# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
# paste code here
git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command
```

# paste code here
git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
# paste code here
 git status
On branch master
nothing to commit, working tree clean

```

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output
```
# paste code here

    add README.md to the repository

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```
# paste code here
diff --git a/README.md b/README.md

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init - makes a new git repository. I see this as a folder where you can use git commands.

* git status - git status show you what branch you're on, any commits, and pending untracked files

* git add - I think of add as an update to the changes you made to a file.

* git commit - git commit bundles everything you added into an update and allows you to comment the changes that were made.

* git log - git log shows you a timestamp of what was added to the repository/ more info about who added what.

* git diff - git diff shows you the changes that were made to the repositroy. Shows the difference between the commit and the repository


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/bmungal/lab03-exercises
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.

Merge queue - merges all pull requests into the busiest branch, in our case main.  

Squash - Allows you to condense multiple commits into one singular commit with an overall summary of the changes. (helps to look neater if you have multiple commits)

Rebase - creating a sepeate head pointer that points to both your new feature branch and your main branch. All conflicts are resolved during this process.
