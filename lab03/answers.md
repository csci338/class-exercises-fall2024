### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init
* git status 
* git add 
* git commit 
* git log 
* git diff 


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

* git init
This initializes a new repository
* git status
This checks the status of git, you can see files that have been added and awaiting commits.
you can also see what branch you are currently on
* git add
This adds a file to the git staging area to be committed
* git commit
This will save the file to the repository with a message describing the change
* git log
This shows a list of commits in order
* git diff
This shows you what has changed from the previous commit to the new commit

## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/isrealmcd/lab03-exercises.git
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.

1 create a merge commit
        this merges the current branch with the main branch
2 squash and merge
        this takes all your commits and turns them into one, then merges it back into the main ranch
3 rebase and merge
        this rebases the branch so each commit then becomes the new base, and finally your last commit 
	becomes the new base of the main branch
