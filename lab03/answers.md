# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
# paste code here

total 8
drwxr-xr-x  4 rubynuss  staff  128 Sep  5 10:18 .
drwxr-xr-x  6 rubynuss  staff  192 Sep  5 10:17 ..

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
# paste code here

    add README.md to the repository

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init
initialize a new git repo

* git status 
list all commits and untracked files

* git add 
add file to be staged for commit

* git commit 
commit changes to github

* git log 
list git history

* git diff 
show changes between before and after commit


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...

```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.
- create a merge commit - everything from current branch will be added to base, all individual commits saved

- squash and merge - all commits from current branch will be combined into 1

- rebase and merge - all commits will be encorporated into front of master branch
