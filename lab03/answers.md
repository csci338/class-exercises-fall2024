# Lab 3 Answers

## Part 1: Git

### 1.1. List the contents of the lab03-exercises repo immediately after initialization
```
.  ..  .git  README.md


```

### 1.2. Paste the output of your `git status` command
```
tairo@LAPTOP-7MBITRAI:~/csci338/lab03-exercises$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Untracked files:
  (use "git add <file>..." to include in what will be committed)
        README.md

nothing added to commit but untracked files present (use "git add" to track)

```

### 1.3. Paste the output of the state of your repository after committing your README.md file
```
tairo@LAPTOP-7MBITRAI:~/csci338/lab03-exercises$ git add README.md
tairo@LAPTOP-7MBITRAI:~/csci338/lab03-exercises$ git status
On branch master

No commits yet

Changes to be committed:
  (use "git rm --cached <file>..." to unstage)
        new file:   README.md

tairo@LAPTOP-7MBITRAI:~/csci338/lab03-exercises$ git commit -m "add README.md to the repository"

### 1.4. Copy your `git log` output
```

Write a function (or static method in the case of Java) that accepts a list of integers and returns a list of only those integers that appear more than once.

```

### 1.5. Copy your `git diff` output
```

### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init: Initilaize git repository in current working directory
* git status: Displays information about working directory, including current branch and modified file (staged and unstaged for commit)
* git add: Add file(s) to staging area, preparing them to be committed.
* git commit: Commit staged files. -m to include a message.
* git log: Shows past commits
* git diff: Compares changes between current working tree and commits


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```
https://github.com/tairobinett/lab03_exercises
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.

Merge commit: Merges changes onto main branch without altering commit history. Have to manually resolve conflicts.
Squash: Combines all commits from branch into one commit on the main branch.
Rebase: Applies all changes onto a new target commit, usually a new, up to date version of main.
