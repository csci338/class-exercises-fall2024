### 1.6. Reflection

We've learned 6 git subcommands now. Describe each of them in your own words in the section below:

* git init - Create a new repository out of the current directory.
* git status - Display information about the repository. Shows staged, unstaged changes and uncommitted changes.
* git add - Stage a file so it can be committed.
* git commit - Adds the staged files to the repository, usually with a given message to describe the changes.
* git log - Shows information about the commits of a repository, particularly the authors, date and description of each commit.
* git diff - Shows the differences between the last commit and the state of the repository before the commit.


### 1.7. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Java)
Make sure you implement the `FindDuplicates.java` class as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).

## Part 2: GitHub

### 2.1. Practice: Find All Duplicates (Python)
Make sure you implement the `find_duplicates.py` file as specified in the instructions (with the nested loops implementation).


## Part 3: Branching

### 3.1. Implement the More Efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem
Implement the more efficient Version of the "Find Duplicates" problem using a dictionary (or hashmap) data structure instead of nested loops. You may do this in either your Python file or in the Java file that youâ€™ve already made. Do this by adding a second function/method to your Java/Python file with a slightly different name.


### 3.2. Link to Repo
Please make sure that the new repo that you made today on GitHub is public, and paste a link to it below.

```bash
# paste your new repo link here...
https://github.com/jforres1/lab03-exercises/
```

### 3.3. What do the three "Merge pull request" options mean? 
Describe each of them in your own words.
-Create Merge Commit
  This option adds all of the commits, but keeps them separate.
-Squash and Merge
  This option condenses all of the changes into a single commit, and pushes it to the main branch.
-Rebase and Merge
  This option adds each commit onto the main branch one at a time, resolving any conflict before moving to the next commit, until all changes have been added to the main branch.
